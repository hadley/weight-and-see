The are two types of barcharts in common use.  The first, as produced by Excel or R, draws a bar at position $x$, with height $y$.  This is often seen in biology publications where the bar represents a mean (and is often accompanied by a standard error).  The second type is more closely connected to a histogram: given a categorical variable, count the number of observations for each level and then draw bars with heights proportional to counts.  We argue that this is more useful for interactive exploration, as the aggregation is built in - you don't need a separate step to first tabulate your data before plotting it.  This type of histogram can be extended naturally to a weighted histogram: instead of counting, we sum the values of another variable.
